    - [X] Do the model description.
    - [ ] Add servo low level control.
      - [X] add gazebo tags.
      - [X] add quaro_control.
      - [X] test interaction with PID controller and higherlevel controller.
      - [X] add controller to controller managers. Not Done since no new hardware or controller was written. Need to look at tuning the pid gains.
      - [ ] tune pid gains. Will change with acctual servos but serves as proxy in the mean time.
